# Security Fixes Applied to Vulnerable Application

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the vulnerable Flask application.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. SQL Injection
**Location**: `app/routes/main_routes.py` (search functionality), `app/routes/auth_routes.py` (login fallback)

**Original Issue**: Direct SQL query construction with user input
**Fix Applied**: 
- Replaced raw SQL queries with SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries
- Added input validation for search queries
- Removed vulnerable SQL fallback in authentication

### 2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
**Location**: Multiple routes in `app/routes/main_routes.py` and `app/routes/api_routes.py`

**Original Issue**: No access control checks for documents, profiles, and admin functions
**Fix Applied**:
- Added access control decorators (`@document_access_required`, `@profile_access_required`, `@admin_required`)
- Implemented centralized access control functions in `app/access_control.py`
- Added proper authorization checks for all sensitive operations

### 3. Path Traversal
**Location**: `app/routes/main_routes.py` (file upload and download)

**Original Issue**: Direct use of user-provided filenames without sanitization
**Fix Applied**:
- Used `secure_filename()` from Werkzeug for file uploads
- Added file type validation and size limits
- Implemented proper path validation for downloads
- Restricted file access to authorized users only

### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Location**: `app/routes/main_routes.py` (comment functionality)

**Original Issue**: User input stored and displayed without sanitization
**Fix Applied**:
- Added HTML content sanitization in `app/utils.py`
- Implemented input validation for comment content
- Ensured proper escaping in templates

### 5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Location**: `app/routes/api_routes.py` (URL fetch functionality)

**Original Issue**: Direct requests to user-provided URLs without validation
**Fix Applied**:
- Added URL validation function `is_safe_url()`
- Blocked requests to localhost, private IP ranges, and dangerous ports
- Implemented request timeouts and security headers

### 6. Insecure Configuration
**Location**: `app/__init__.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `app.py`

**Original Issue**: Hardcoded insecure secrets and weak default passwords
**Fix Applied**:
- Generated secure random secret keys
- Updated default database credentials
- Added secure session cookie configuration
- Implemented proper environment variable handling
- Created `.env.example` for production guidance

## Security Enhancements Added

### Input Validation (`app/utils.py`)
- Username validation (length, character restrictions)
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- File upload validation (type, size, filename)
- Search query sanitization
- Comment content validation

### Access Control (`app/access_control.py`)
- Role-based access control decorators
- Centralized permission checking functions
- Admin privilege verification
- Document ownership validation
- User profile access control

### Security Headers and Configuration
- Secure session cookie settings
- HTTP-only and SameSite cookie attributes
- Maximum file upload size limits
- Session timeout configuration

## Default Credentials (Changed)

**Original (Insecure)**:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- User: `user1` / `user123`
- Database: `root` / `insecure_password`

**New (Secure)**:
- Admin: `admin` / `SecureAdmin2024!`
- User: `user1` / `SecureUser2024!`
- Database: `vulnuser` / `secure_random_password_123!`

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Set secure values for all environment variables in production
2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
3. **Database Security**: Use strong, unique passwords and restrict database access
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for API endpoints
7. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the security fixes:

1. **SQL Injection**: Try injecting SQL in search queries - should be sanitized
2. **IDOR**: Attempt to access other users' documents/profiles - should be blocked
3. **Path Traversal**: Try uploading files with malicious names - should be sanitized
4. **XSS**: Submit HTML/JavaScript in comments - should be escaped
5. **SSRF**: Try fetching internal URLs via API - should be blocked

## Files Modified

- `app/__init__.py` - Security configuration
- `app/routes/main_routes.py` - Fixed IDOR, Path Traversal, XSS
- `app/routes/auth_routes.py` - Fixed SQL Injection, added validation
- `app/routes/api_routes.py` - Fixed SSRF, IDOR, improved access control
- `app/utils.py` - Added input validation functions
- `app/access_control.py` - Added access control system
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated secure configuration
- `app.py` - Changed default passwords
- `.env.example` - Added environment variable template

All fixes maintain the application's functionality while significantly improving its security posture.
