    {
      "name": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "The application contains a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in the API endpoint that fetches external resources. This allows an attacker to make requests to internal services that should not be accessible from outside the network.",
      "exploitation_steps": "Attacker crafts requests to GET /api/fetch?api_key=insecure_api_key_123&url=http://internal-server/secret.txt to force the server to fetch internal resources. The response demonstrates internal access (INTERNAL_SECRET_FLAG{ssrf_test_successful_internal_access}) and reveals internal details.",
      "impact": "Access to internal network resources and services; Potential to bypass network security controls; Information disclosure of internal system details; Possible pivot point for further attacks",
      "remediation": "Implement strict validation of user-supplied URLs; Use an allowlist of permitted domains; Disable requests to internal IP addresses and domains; Implement network segmentation to limit access from application servers",

      "name": "SQL Injection in Login Form",

      "exploitation_steps": "Submit payload: username=admin' or '1'='1 -- &password=admin' or '1'='1 -- (url encoded is admin%27%20or%20%271%27%3D%271%20--%20) (Decoded: \"admin' or '1'='1' -- \"). This causes authentication bypass (HTTP 302) and sets a session.",
      "impact": "Authentication bypass; Potential for complete database compromise; Data exfiltration; Possible remote code execution depending on database configuration",
      "remediation": "Use parameterized queries or prepared statements; Implement proper input validation and sanitization; Apply the principle of least privilege to database accounts; Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect SQL injection attempts",

      "cvss_score": 8.8

      "name": "Local File Inclusion (Path Traversal)",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "The file download functionality is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files.",
      "exploitation_steps": "Craft requests attempting to traverse directories to access sensitive files (e.g., /passwd) via the file download endpoint; The response includes file contents and metadata, including a passwd-like listing.",
      "impact": "Unauthorized access to sensitive system files; Potential disclosure of credentials or configuration files; Possible step toward remote code execution",
      "remediation": "Implement strict path validation; Use a whitelist of allowed files; Normalize paths before processing; Run the application with least privilege permissions",

      "exploitation_steps": "Request to GET /profile/2 to view another user's profile (e.g., user1's profile).",
      "impact": "Unauthorized access to other users' personal information; Potential for further attacks using gathered information; Violation of privacy regulations",
      "remediation": "Implement proper access control checks; Use indirect object references; Implement role-based access control; Log access attempts to sensitive resources",
      "cve": null,
      "cvss_score": 5.3
    },
    {
      "name": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "The comment functionality is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks, allowing persistent injection of JavaScript code.",
      "exploitation_steps": "Submit content containing <script>alert(\"XSS\")</script> to /comment, then retrieve /document/1 where the script is rendered and executed.",
      "impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers; Potential for session hijacking if combined with other vulnerabilities; Defacement of application content",
      "remediation": "Implement proper output encoding; Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers; Sanitize user input before storage; Consider using a safe rendering approach",
